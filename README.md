This is a small app that creates and simple Master/Detail App, that uses the MVVM Design Pattern. The app adds the following features:

- The application consumes a Restful web service for "The New York Times" News
- The main page that consumes the web service & provides the lazy loading support when you scroll down on the list
- When you tap over an item, you can see the details of it, which in this case is a Xamarin WebView Form
